## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge, I practiced a bit with something stylistically easier than the last one (the space agency challenge), I set up the work using Flexbox for the general layout, and for the internal blocks, like the input field; I had a bit of difficulty with the Javascript implementation of the 'Submit button' linked to tab switching, and I had to seek help from other people's solutions and watching a video about this topic.

Overall it was interesting, a great workout!

### Continued development

In the next period I want to face various challenges, both regarding individual components, as in this case, web pages that are a bit more complex and articulated.
